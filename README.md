The enhancements that i have done are  I have rewritten the entire code in a modular format using functions for better readability and maintainability and have taken input dynamically.
Additionally, I have introduced a new file, generate_data.py, which is used to generate data for my tables. I have added two new SQL queries that were required for these enhancements.
